Currently, ARTEM-IS has launched the first of its tools, ARTEM-IS for ERP, which supports describing a simple ERP experiment, including most of its core methodological aspects (study description, experimental design, hardware, data acquisition, pre-processing, measurement, visualisation, additional comments \u2013 artemis.incf.org). ARTEM-IS tools for more complex ERP experiments as well as for other subfields of EEG may follow.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#how-to-use-it","title":"How to use it","text":"<ol> <li>The web-app is available HERE.</li> <li>On the initial page, you can create your account and log in, as well as view a visualization of the basic structure of the information provided in the template.</li> <li>Once logged in, by clicking <code>Create</code> in the top right corner, you can create a new, blank template.</li> <li>You can navigate a template by using the menu on top and answer the questions corresponding to the study you are reporting on.

Transparent methods records would allow not only better reproducibility and replicability of EEG research or a better appraisal of the quality of existing studies, but also provide a better basis for novel research, for example by providing meta-scientists with relevant information on published studies. Researchers new to the field of EEG may especially benefit from transparent and thorough reports of EEG studies, as some of them are not beneficiaries of the decades of knowledge contained in unpublished materials like \u2018lab handbooks\u2019 which may be passed down in labs with longer traditions.</p> <p>Despite this, systematic reviews of reporting practices in the field have shown that journal articles do not meet this goal and that guidelines for writing them better have not resulted in a sufficient improvement to reporting transparency. ARTEM-IS is designed to help with this issue as ARTEM-IS reports contain a level of reporting precision higher than what is typically found in journal articles, which can be used as supplements to a publication, as a memory aid when writing a paper, or as records that allow easier metadata extraction in comparison to verbal descriptions in papers.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#want-to-know-more","title":"Want to know more ?","text":"<p>Read more about the rationale for this project and the design principles we go by in our paper, and if you agree support us by signing the ARTEM-IS statement.</p> <ol> <li>Have a look at our project on OSF.</li> <li>Talks and slides are available HERE.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"CHANGELOG.html","title":"Release notes","text":""},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"CONTRIBUTING","text":""},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#want-to-help","title":"Want to help?","text":"<p>If you want to join this project, please check out our INCF Working Group and apply for joining it by filling in this form.</p>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>ARTEM-IS is developed by an INCF working group, in partnership with eCOBIDAS.</p> <p>A centralized list of the people who contributed to this project can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#serve-the-website-locally-on-your-computer","title":"Serve the website locally (on your computer)","text":""},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Python</li> </ul> <p>To install all the necessary packages, type the following in a terminal in the root of the repository:</p> <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#serve-the-website","title":"Serve the website","text":"<p>Type the following in a terminal in the root of the repository:</p> <pre><code>mkdocs serve\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#how-to-update-the-spreadsheet","title":"How to update the spreadsheet","text":"<p>There is an automated workflow that will grab the different ARTEMIS spreadsheet from google drive and merge them into a single spreadsheet.</p> <p>It can be triggered manually:</p> <ul> <li>Go to the action tab of the repository (only visible if you are a maintainer of the repository)</li> <li>Select the \"workflow\" you want to run (in this case the \"Update spreadsheet\" workflow)</li> <li>Click on the <code>Run workflow</code> dropdown and then on the <code>Run workflow</code> button</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Once the workflow has finished, if there are any changes in the content of the spreadsheet,   the workflow will have opened a \"pull-request\", that you can view in the <code>Pull requests</code> tab.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>You can inspect the changes made in the spreadsheets by opening the pull-request   and then clicking on the <code>Files changed</code> tab.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>If you are OK with the changes, you can approve them by clicking on the <code>Merge pull request</code> button   in the <code>Conversation</code> tab.</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"contact.html","title":"contact","text":""},{"location":"contact.html#get-in-touch","title":"Get in touch","text":"<p>Want to know more?
