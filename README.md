## Agreed Reporting Template for EEG Methodology - International Standard: template for event-related potentials (ERP)

The goal of the ARTEM-IS is to use insights derived from systematic reviews to create both human-friendly and machine-readable templates for documenting the methodological details of an EEG study or pipeline. The template for reporting ERP methodology before you is a pilot project of ARTEM-IS, based on which other subfields of EEG may follow.

## How to use it

1. The demo version of the web-app is (currently and temporarily) available **[HERE](http://psihologija.ff.uns.ac.rs/erp/)**.
2. On the initial page, you can create your account and log in, as well as view a visualization of the basic structure of the information provided in the template.
3. Once logged in, by clicking `Submit` in the top right corner, you can create a new, blank template.
4. You can navigate a template by using the menu on top and answer the questions corresponding to the study you are reporting on. This is meant to ensure that you have not forgotten any of the essential information during data collection or later in the methods and results parts of your article.
5. Click `Save` in the top right corner to save any changes.
6. You can view your own saved templates using `My templates` option. For each template, you have the options to make them publically (in)visible to others, download a human-readable PDF output and download a machine-readable JSON output. All templates are set to private in the beginning.
7. You can view and download publically available templates by other members using `Browse` menu.
8. You can upload a previously downloaded (in JSON format) templates to your account using `Upload` menu.

## Why this project?

As the number of EEG papers increases, so too does the number of guidelines for how to report what has been done.  However, current guidelines and checklists appear to  have limited adoption, as systematic reviews have shown  that the journal article format is prone to errors, ambiguities and omissions of methodological details (Clayson et al., 2019; Šoškić et al., 2021, see also Carp, 2012). This is a problem for transparency in the scientific record, along with reproducibility and metascience.

New reporting tools are needed to overcome the limitations of written methodology descriptions. To be truly useful, these tools need to allow documenting detailed methodology information in supplementary material (and thus also support more precise written descriptions in journal articles), and they should be both intuitive to complete and foolproof-by-design. In order to achieve this, reporting tools should be developed through community consultation to ensure that they have the most utility for EEG stakeholders.
