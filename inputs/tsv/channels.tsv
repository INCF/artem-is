Selection of channels for analysis	In this section, you will describe channels selected for statistical analysis and the decision-making process behind it. This is a section about selection of the region that will be subjected to statistical analysis, and not the analysis itself.	Did you make a selection of channels for the purposes of statistical analysis?	For example, if you conducted an analysis such as cluster-based permutation tests on the entire scalp, you should pick "all channels were submitted to analysis", and not describe permutation tests in this section. If you completed cluster-based permutation tests on a subset of electrodes, you should select the other option, and then describe how this subset of electrodes was selected in the follow-up questions.	radio	all channels were submitted to statistical analysis | a subset of channels was submitted to statistical analysis	channels_all_vs_subset	1	1	1	1	Channels	7
Selection of channels for analysis		What was the rationale for selecting this exact subset of electrodes?	When you are making this decision, you may want to check out papers by Kriegskorte et al.
