Preamp peripherals	In this section you will describe hardware choices such as model of amplifier, cap and electrodes used in the study, triggers and additional devices used.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	How were the EEG electrodes placed?			radio	cap or net | single electrodes	electrode_placement_type	1	1	1	1	Hardware	3	CapManufacturersModelName	*_eeg.json
