Preamp peripherals	In this section you will describe hardware choices such as model of amplifier, cap and electrodes used in the study, triggers and additional devices used.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	How were the EEG electrodes placed?			radio	cap or net | single electrodes	electrode_placement_type	1	1	1	1	Hardware	3	CapManufacturersModelName	*_eeg.json

Electrode positioning		Which extension of the 10-20 system will you use to describe electrode positions?		We recommend selecting the 5% convention (Oostenveld & Praamstra, 2001) as it is the latest version.	radio	5% convention | 10-10 convention | 10-20 convention	ten-twenty_version	electrode_location_naming_convention == 0	14	1	1	Hardware	3				
Electrode positioning		Number of EEG electrodes that were used for acquisition (including, if they are on scalp, ground and reference electrodes, as well as earlobes; excluding EOG and other non-EEG electrodes).		This should not include empty slots on the cap where electrodes were not placed, if there were such slots.	integer		number_EEG_electrodes	1	15	1	1	Hardware	3				
Electrode positioning		The appropriate methods description should also include a list or a scheme of all electrode locations. This is currently not available in ARTEM-IS due to technical limitations, so please provide a link where the sceheme/list can be found.		This can be a public preregistration document, OSF file, preprint, or a publication.	text		link_electrode_scheme	1	16	1	1	Hardware	3
