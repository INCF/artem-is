Measurement	This is a section where amplitude and latency measurement are described.  NOTE: At the moment, you can describe one component (one time window and location) in one template, with its latency and/or amplitude measured in multiple different ways. If you have measured multiple components, you can make a copy (or copies) of the template and change appropriate sections to reflect how you measured these other components. If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	Did this study include measuring amplitude and/or latency for the purposes of later statistical analysis?		Select no if you did not measure latency or amplitude for the purposes of statistical analysis in the next step. For example, you may have conducted a mass univariate analysis and you did not subject locations and time windows obtained by mass univariate approach to another statistical analysis, or you may have conducted a source analysis.	radio	preset:boolean	measure_intro	1	1	1	1	Measurement	6
