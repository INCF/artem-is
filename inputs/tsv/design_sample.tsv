Sample size	In this section you will decrobe the experimental design and sample, such as experimental condition and trial number per condition, number of participants, participant exclusion and presenting software.  NOTE: If you notice a bug, or have a suggestion, we'd be grateful if you posted an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/INCF/artem-is/	How many subjects participated in the study?		integer		sample_size_total	1	1	1	1	design_and_sample	2		participants.tsv?
