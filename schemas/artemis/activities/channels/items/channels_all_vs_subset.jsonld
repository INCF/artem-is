You will be asked about potential channel averaging into ROIs later in this section. How to choose option here: For example, if you conducted an analysis such as cluster-based permutation tests on the entire scalp, you should pick \"all channels were submitted to analysis\", and not describe permutation tests in this section. If you completed cluster-based permutation tests on a subset of channels, you should select the other option, and then describe how this subset of channels was selected in the follow-up questions.</details></div>"
