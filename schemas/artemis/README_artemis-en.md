## Agreed Reporting Template for EEG Methodology - International Standard: template for event-related potentials (ERP)

The goal of the ARTEM-IS is to use insights derived from systematic reviews to
create human-friendly, machine-readable templates for documenting the
methodological details of an EEG study or pipeline. The template for reporting
ERP methodology before you is a pilot project of ARTEM-IS, based on which other
subfields of EEG may follow.

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
corresponding to your study. This is meant to ensure that you have not forgotten
any of the essential information during data collection or later in the methods
and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing
a set of machine readable files that summarize the information about your
acquisition protocol.

For now you could then use those files as a supplement for your publication, but
we are also working on creating more human-friendly outputs.

## Why this project?

As the number of EEG papers increases, so too does the number of guidelines for
how to report what has been done. However, current guidelines and checklists
appear to have limited adoption, as systematic reviews have shown that the
journal article format is prone to errors, ambiguities and omissions of
methodological details (Clayson et al., 2019; Šoškić et al., 2021, see also
Carp, 2012). This is a problem for transparency in the scientific record, along
with reproducibility and metascience.

New reporting tools are needed to overcome the limitations of written
methodology descriptions. To be truly useful, these tools need to allow
documenting detailed methodology information in supplementary material (and thus
also support more precise written descriptions in journal articles), and they
should be both intuitive to complete and foolproof-by-design. In order to
achieve this, reporting tools should be developed through community consultation
to ensure that they have the most utility for EEG stakeholders.
